# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## 3.12.2 - 2026-10-09

- Add optional `expectedUserPrincipalName` account binding. Bound installations
  request `User.Read`, verify Microsoft Graph `/me` before any Calendar, Mail,
  To Do or OneDrive operation, and fail closed on a different delegated user.
- Cache the verified identity per access token to keep the steady-state path
  fast, and include the verified Microsoft identity in successful results so
  downstream receipts can prove both the operation and its account boundary.

## 3.12.0 - 2026-10-07

- Integrate the authenticated Native OS/Gemacode socket boundary and one-use
  execution permits with the Microsoft account setup, workspace-upload and
  session-generation protections introduced through 3.11.0.
- Add compact, fail-closed Calendar, Microsoft To Do and OneDrive operations
  for local models. The adapters reuse Graph policy, credential, approval,
  instruction and exact-target controls instead of widening permissions.
- Expose versioned, process-local compact read and operation bridges for the
  Gemacode route. They require trusted caller and tool-call identities, retain
  the Native execution gate and are not network services.
- Keep package, OpenClaw manifest and installation metadata on one exact
  version so compatibility and provenance checks can reject mixed installs.
- Require exact read-after-write verification by provider resource ID for
  compact Microsoft To Do and Outlook Calendar creations.
- Return the verified provider resource and destination list metadata through
  compact operation protocol v3 so callers cannot treat a write response alone
  as proof that the resource exists.

## 3.11.4 - 2026-10-07

- Restore the feature-focused ClawHub subtitle: “Bring Outlook mail and calendar, OneDrive files, and Microsoft To Do into OpenClaw with per-agent access you control.” Keep the display name and README attribution unchanged.

## 3.11.3 - 2026-10-07

- Present the plugin as “Connect Microsoft 365 to OpenClaw” with the attribution “Independent community plugin by Baumus” across ClawHub metadata, README, and Control UI. This is a display-name and copy change only; the package name, plugin ID, permissions, tools, and configuration keys remain unchanged.

## 3.11.2 - 2026-10-07

- Restore the manifest tool contract required by OpenClaw 2026.9.8. The v3.11.1 package installed but left all Microsoft Graph agent tools unavailable on that host; v3.11.2 restores registration without changing Graph permissions, tool behavior, or policy.

## 3.11.1 - 2026-10-07

- Remove the unsupported generated tool contract from the plugin manifest while keeping runtime tool registration and supported tool metadata intact. The build now strips that field so future packages remain ClawHub-valid.

## 3.11.0 - 2026-10-07

- Guide Microsoft account connection from saved, non-secret app identifiers or two clearly labeled fields, with a separate Entra administrator path. Identifiers are stored only in the current browser after a successful device-code start; sign-in and consent remain unverified until the existing flow completes.
- Show explicit Microsoft device-code steps, pending state, and a user-facing failure handoff with copyable, bounded diagnostics. Keep existing vault, policy, and credential protections unchanged.
- Add responsive styling, reviewed translations, and DOM tests for the fast path, missing identifiers, and failure path.

## 3.10.1 - 2026-10-06

- Accept Microsoft's exact `https://www.microsoft.com/link` verification page for personal-account device-code sign-in, while continuing to reject lookalike and altered destinations. Thanks to [@DevilBehindTheSofa](https://github.com/DevilBehindTheSofa) for the clear report and verified workaround in [#28](https://github.com/Baumus/openclaw-microsoft-graph-plugin/issues/28).
- Replace the removed `infra-runtime` SDK import with the existing direct `@openclaw/fs-safe` dependency for protected local-file access.
## 3.10.0 - 2026-10-06

- Show a read-only update badge beside the established-connection status when ClawHub reports a newer, security-clean stable plugin release. The administrator-scoped Gateway check sends no credentials or policy data, is bounded and cached, and never installs an update.

## 3.9.0 - 2026-10-05

- Upload or replace a workspace-created file in one OneDrive call with `sourceWorkspacePath`. The plugin confines and streams the file into private inbound media, hashes it before native approval, verifies the staged bytes again before Graph access, and retains the existing `sourceMediaUri` path for already-staged files.
- Make source selection, path constraints, MIME inference, and recovery guidance explicit in the tool schemas and descriptions.
- Bind native mutation approval to the persisted session generation when the Host supplies only a session key; reject missing or reset sessions before approval or execution without changing OpenClaw Core.

## 3.8.1 - 2026-10-03

- Build and validate this release with OpenClaw 2026.9.8; keep the compatible host floor at 2026.9.6.
- Fix native approval snapshots across plugin module instances and resolve protected inbound media from the authoritative Gateway state root, preventing substituted or unreachable attachment inputs. Thanks to [@BrewingCoder](https://github.com/BrewingCoder) for the report and initial fix in [#22](https://github.com/Baumus/openclaw-microsoft-graph-plugin/pull/22).
- Accept a successful Microsoft Graph `201 Created` attachment response with an attachment ID regardless of provider-reported `size`. Report the locally known uploaded byte count without implying a content readback, and avoid misleading retry guidance after creation. Thanks to [@BrewingCoder](https://github.com/BrewingCoder) for the report and initial fix in [#24](https://github.com/Baumus/openclaw-microsoft-graph-plugin/pull/24).

## 3.8.0 - 2026-10-03

- Make every agent tool self-describing at runtime and add caller-scoped, read-only `microsoft_graph_capabilities` discovery without credentials or Graph calls.
- Add bounded `timeoutMs` transport metadata to mutation schemas, strip it before semantic approval and provider execution, and validate mutation syntax/policy before native approval. Critical managed-root deletion now requires cached instruction acknowledgement before prompting.
- Add additive lifecycle, retry-safety, mutation-certainty, send-acceptance, and pagination guidance to tool results. Legacy chat confirmation fields remain accepted but ignored.

## 3.7.0 - 2026-10-03

- Let OneDrive upload/update callers omit SHA-256 and byte size: the plugin derives both from protected inbound media before native approval and re-verifies the approved identity before transfer. Supplied values remain strict paired assertions.
- Explain the self-contained upload and critical-delete approval contracts in tool descriptions and documentation, including the host-owned `operator.approvals` requirement.

## 3.6.0 - 2026-10-02

- Redesign OneDrive access as responsive folder cards showing every authorized agent. Read/write/delete bubbles now toggle permissions directly; each card also exposes adding agents and a confirmed folder-removal action while preserving the review-and-save workflow.

## 3.5.4 - 2026-10-02

- Collapse the completed setup checklist to a compact connection status only when the vault SecretRef, saved agent grant, applied rules, and valid Microsoft credential are confirmed. This does not claim that an agent read has been tested.
- Keep actionable setup and sign-in states for missing or regressed prerequisites. Hide redundant connected sign-in and applied-version success cards, and show the policy source while editing or handling a save error.

## 3.5.3 - 2026-10-01

- Accept Microsoft's `https://login.microsoft.com/device` device-code verification page while keeping the browser destination on an exact allowlist.
- Accept the required `offline_access` scope in CLI sign-in start and completion results.
- Accept equivalent Microsoft Graph `mailFolders('id')` continuation paths only when they resolve to the exact expected mail collection; preserve origin and traversal checks.
- Add synthetic regression tests for sign-in validation and multi-page mail reads.

## 3.5.2 — Guided setup status

- Show a setup checklist and the next required step for the vault key, agent grant, applied policy, and Microsoft connection.
- Keep account connection distinct from verified agent access; the first read still requires an explicit authorized test.
- Present access rules before the sign-in card so the UI follows the actual setup dependency order.
- Clarify that a user-owned public-client Entra app with device-code sign-in needs no callback service or redirect URI; tokens remain in the local encrypted vault.

## 3.5.1 - 2026-10-01

- Refresh public positioning, installation guidance, and package metadata for Microsoft 365 for OpenClaw; no runtime permission or API changes.

## 3.5.0 - 2026-10-01

- Add a guided, four-language Control UI sign-in that opens Microsoft in the browser, displays the one-time code, tracks completion, and supports cancellation. Keep the terminal helper as an alternative.
- Remove the legacy `migrate-from-pass` command and Gateway method; preserve optional `restore-pass` emergency backup.

## 3.4.0 - 2026-09-30

- Localize the Microsoft Graph configuration UI for English, German, Spanish, and Arabic, with English fallback for other host locales.
- Resize the packaged plugin identity icon to OpenClaw’s recommended 512 × 512 pixels for reliable display.

## 3.3.2 - 2026-09-30

- Show a persistent saved-versus-applied Gateway status in Microsoft Graph Zugriff, recheck pending application automatically for one minute, and offer a manual status check without claiming success when revision evidence is missing.

## 3.3.1 - 2026-09-29

- Refine the Microsoft Graph access UI with readable theme-aware controls, clearer hierarchy, responsive layout, and a non-overlapping footer.
- Rename the app navigation and page to “Microsoft Graph Zugriff”.

## 3.3.0 - 2026-09-29

- Narrow the native Microsoft access page to OneDrive folder/agent rights, per-agent Calendar/Mail/To Do use, and per-service warning approvals. Preserve critical call-bound approval and existing fine-grained grants.
- Resolve new OneDrive folder paths to immutable drive/item IDs through an admin-only, bounded, credential-backed Gateway query; no token or provider content enters the browser.
- Keep service warning approvals inside the policy so one Gateway config patch can write through a supported single-file `$include` boundary.


## 3.2.0 - 2026-09-29

- Add a native, configuration-only Microsoft Graph Control UI page with guided resources, per-agent permissions, review, and admin-scoped validation.
- Save policy changes through revision-checked `config.patch` on a supported single-file include boundary; keep credential migration and recovery in the CLI.
- Require OpenClaw 2026.9.6 for the native UI and browser asset contract.

## 3.1.0 - 2026-09-25

- Bound native approval copy, severity, decisions, and execution to one exact host-composed parameter snapshot. The plugin now makes its inspected parameters authoritative in the OpenClaw hook result and rejects any later execution-time rewrite, including warning-to-critical changes after process-local `allow-always` trust.
- Capped each calendar multiwrite at 100 operations in schema and runtime.
- Replaced bespoke chat-confirmation authority with configurable OpenClaw-native warning approval. Warning approval defaults on, supports process-lifetime agent/tool/action `allow-always` trust, and leaves critical mutations at `allow-once` or `deny`; legacy chat fields are inert compatibility inputs.
- Added privacy-minimized native approval copy that names the action, target, and action-specific risk, including OneDrive root/path, calendar/event identity, multiwrite counts, and recipient-count context.
- Bound every OneDrive upload and replacement to required SHA-256 and byte-size claims, verified against an immutable opened artifact before credentials or Graph access.

## 3.0.0 - 2026-09-25

- Initial public release.
- Added a credential-free, default-deny policy in resolved `plugins.entries["microsoft-graph"].config.policy`.
- Added one shared delegated OAuth credential, one encrypted vault record, one lock/quarantine lifecycle, and one SecretRef-only `credentialVaultKey`.
- Routed credential status, migration, restore, and recovery through strictly validated, operator-scoped Gateway RPC methods so local CLI loads never depend on unresolved SecretRef config.
- Added single-source migration and single-destination backup/restore receipts.
- Kept transactional bounded access-token caching, dedicated OAuth request timeouts, durable uncertainty quarantine, authorization/approval ordering, and fail-closed secure storage.
- Documented that vault generations have no external monotonic anchor and that replay of an older valid encrypted backup remains an operator-managed residual risk.
- Added exact-pinned `@openclaw/fs-safe` 0.13.1, a version-2 policy example, migration documentation, and deterministic vault/config/CLI/rotation tests.
- Added manifest and runtime schema validation for the complete default-deny policy while preserving authorization before GNU `pass` credential access.
- Added normal OpenClaw host-level `$include` composition guidance for splitting the policy into a JSON5 file.
- Added bounded OneDrive, Outlook Calendar, Outlook Mail, and Microsoft To Do tool coverage, private-media transfer, continuation handling, provider timeout/retry controls, and deterministic synthetic tests.
- Capped each confirmed calendar multiwrite at 100 operations in schema and runtime.
